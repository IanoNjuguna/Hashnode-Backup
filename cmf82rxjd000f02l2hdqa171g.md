The first user experience in a dapp is the wallet connection. Mess it up and you lose a client or a potential lead.  
  
We seamlessly connect popular EVM wallets to our dApp through the "[viem module](https://viem.sh/)" from a web app. To do this, we break down the wallet connection into 4 cyclical steps:  
✅ Detecting if Ethereum provider exists  
✅ Requesting account access  
✅ Managing state and UI updates  
✅ Basic error handling  
  
I hope this breakdown is helpful. What other Web3 development challenges would you like to see simplified?
