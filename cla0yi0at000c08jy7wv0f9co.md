Input and Output (`I/O`) is one of the basic functions of a computing device.

If we consider the result of all programming to be telling hardware what to do:

* Under the hood of the computing device, input is received and processed then output is generated.
    
* In programming, I/O operations guide how data is manipulated to produce relevant outcomes.
    

## I/O Rules

I/O operations are straightforward:

1. Input comes from the standard input device, i.e: `stdin`.
    
2. Output is generated by the standard output device, i.e: `stdout`.
    

## I/O Devices

Conventionally, `stdin` is the keyboard but the input can also be redirected by the OS to make it come from a device like a WiFi router/modem or from a file, while `stdout` is the display, but the output can be redirected so that it goes to another device, such as a printer or into a file.
