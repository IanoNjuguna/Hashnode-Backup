Night is a Cardano native asset that serves as the native utility token of the Midnight Network.  
It’s launch on 4th Dec 2025, kicked off a redemption process which will last 360 days, where more than 4.5 billion $NIGHT will claimed by the community. These tokens will be unlocked gradually in 4 installments.

Each destination address will be assigned a randomized date between December 10, 2025 and early March 2026. After this date, the remaining three installments unlock every 90 days.  
  
This token unlock model ensures the price of $NIGHT remains stable through out the year and will prevent price shocks caused by the folks who grab tokens at a Token Generation Event (TGE) and dump them right away.
