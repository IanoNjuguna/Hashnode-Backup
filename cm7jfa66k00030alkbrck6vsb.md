The confidential mode on Gmail is an underrated feature that lets you do the following:

1. Set an email expiration date. Ranging from 1 week to 5 years.
    
2. Require a verification code for the recipient to read your email.
    
3. Revoke access to the email at any time of your bidding.
    

To toggle it, you click on the padlock icon - located to the left hand side of the big blue ‘SEND’ button, highlighted in the below image.

With the confidential mode on, your messages don't have options to forward, copy, print, and download messages or attachments. That said, it can't prevent the recipients from taking screenshots or photos of your messages and attachments.
