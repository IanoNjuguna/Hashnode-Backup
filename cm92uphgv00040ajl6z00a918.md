Betavolt Technology, based in China, have developed the **BV100**: a battery which generates electric current from electrons emitted by a radioactive nickel isotope that decays into stable copper. This event is a marvel of our lifetime since the battery has a 50 year usage cycle, is roughly the same size as a coin, is the first nuclear powered battery to be mass produced, and even though the current is relatively weak - the cell requires minimal maintenance over the 50 year period.  
It is suitable in instances where there’s a need for long-term, low-power application such as in micro-sensors, micro-robots, micro-drones, and components of AI, aerospace, and medical equipment.

The 50 year charge claim is backed by the fact that Nickel-63, the nickel isotope used, has a half-life of 101.2 years. While the isotope decays, the power output of the battery decreases. After one half-life (101.2 years), the power output will be about 50% of the initial output. After two half-lives (202.4 years), it will be about 25% of the initial output, and so forth.  
The practical operational lifespan of such a battery is less than the half-life of the isotope because the power output drops below a threshold that is no longer sufficient for the intended application, but because the nickel isotope decays into stable copper - the cost and risk of recycling or disposing the battery are low.  
However we put it and regardless of the flaws, 50 years is a significantly longer time-frame for usage than that of conventional batteries.

The current point in History is an inflection point, as it is hard to imagine how this decade will change our world, yet, there’s consensus that the *zeitgeist* is shifting by the second. When you couple that with the uncertain political environment ushered in by the dubious economic choices most governments made to ‘keep their respective economies afloat’ during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, the **BV100** is a ray of sunshine piercing the clouds after a raging storm.  
What makes me bullish, is the realisation that miniature, modular and low cost atomic batteries for civilian uses will definitively trigger a domino effect in the energy sector and the trickle down effect will raise global living standards.
