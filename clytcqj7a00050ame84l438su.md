Following the June 25th [#OccupyParliament](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=occupyparliament&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7220209126058958849) protests[,](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=occupyparliament&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7220209126058958849) [Safaricom PLC](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=occupyparliament&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7220209126058958849) were caught flat-footed.  

![Protests over a the 2024 finance bill | June 25 | #OccupyParliament](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/81ba/live/b491e010-32f5-11ef-bdc5-41d7421c2adf.jpg align="right")

  
There were allegations that Safaricom doxxed protestors thereby abetting their abductions by state authorities. On top of that, they were also accused of throttling the internet at times when it is on public record that the state meted out atrocities on the citizens.  
Obviously, they denied the allegations but that wasn't the first time nor will it be the last that Kenyans will be at the mercy of the clout Safaricom currently wields over the Kenyan economy.  
  
Almost a year ago, on July 28th, a cyber attack on Kenya's digital banking infrastructure left us stranded for hours on end. For the first time in a long while, Kenyans had money they couldn't spend yet it wasn't by choice. Safaricom's MPESA were a casualty that day, and based on the number of users subscribed to their services, I reckon they were the most affected.  
  
That got me thinking. Times are changing and the tide is turning. The current age requires us to subscribe to a healthy cocktail of TradFi and DeFi solutions to insulate ourselves when the cons posed by either come knocking at our doors. Placing your loyalties on the traditional means of handling finances will leave you naked in the July cold. Stand guided.
