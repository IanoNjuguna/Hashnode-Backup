### What does `getchar()` do?

The `getchar()` function gets a character from the standard input. It does not have arguments hence, the parentheses are always empty.

It is defined this way:
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int getchar();
```

Technically, `getchar()` is not a function. It is a macro.
A macro is a shortcut based on another function, as defined in the `<stdio.h>` header file. This is why the  `<stdio.h>` header file is to be included within your source code.

The real function to get characters from standard input is `getc();` and it is defined in this way:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int c;

c = getc(stdin);
```
In the above example, `getc();` reads from the `stdin` as defined in the header file. The function returns an integer value, which is stored in variable `c`.

#### NB: `getchar();` returns an integer value and not a character value.

### Sample Code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
int i;

printf(" The character is: ");
i=getchar();
printf("%c. \n", i);
return(0);
}
```
When the `getchar()` function is invoked, the character returned is stored in the `i` integer variable. The second printf() function will display the character stored in the variable.
It is important to note that the `%c` placeholder is used to display single characters. This is because the integer variable, `i`, contains a character value. 

### How To Create a Program That Displays a Characterâ€™s ASCII Code Value In Decimal.

When the `%d` placeholder is used instead of `%c`, whatever will be displayed when the code is run is the variable's ASCII code value.
This is because `%d` displays that value instead of a character value. To understand this, you have to consider that a computing device will treat all information as ones and zeros under the hood and the ASCII code is a value of the information that will be presented to you.
It is only when information is displayed as a character, `%c`, does it look like text.
This is how I created an [ASCII-Program](https://github.com/IanoNjuguna/ASCII-Program)
